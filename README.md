An Implementation of the Fisher-Yates Shuffle
=============================================

Stratus3D

**Note: The Fisher-Yates shuffle is very inefficient in Erlang due to the lack of an "Array" type. I created a function (`fisher\_yates\_shuffle:improved\_shuffle/1`) that provides a more efficient way of shuffling lists **

## Description
