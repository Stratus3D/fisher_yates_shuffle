An Implementation of the Fisher-Yates Shuffle
=============================================

Stratus3D

**Note: The Fisher-Yates shuffle is very inefficient in Erlang due to the lack of a "Array" type. There are probably better ways of shuffle data in Erlang**

## Description
A simple implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle in Erlang. More information on the Fisher-Yates shuffle is available here: ([http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)). There is also a implementation of the shuffle in JavaScript in the `js/` directory.
